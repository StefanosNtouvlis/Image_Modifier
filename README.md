# Image_Modifier
Simple image processor with the Pillow library of Python.
 
Extremely simple, but amazingly powerful code, that can be expanded with ease. 
You just place the desired images at the imgs folder, run the program and the edited images appear on the namesake folder.

P.S. Sorry for the mogging in the pics!
